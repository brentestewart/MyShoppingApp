# üóì Project Description: Shopping List Application

## üöÄ Purpose

This project is a shopping list application designed to help users efficiently manage their shopping across multiple physical and online stores. It aims to simplify list organization, price comparison, and in-store navigation.

The application supports multiple users and allows for shared access through user-defined groups. For example, a family can create and manage a shared grocery list together.

## üåç Core Functionality

### üßë‚Äçü§ù‚Äçüßë Users and Groups

- Users can belong to one or more **Groups**.
- Groups represent collections of users such as families, roommates, or friends.
- Shopping lists and stores can be associated with a group to enable sharing and collaboration.

### üè∞ Stores

Each store can represent a physical location or an online retailer. A store includes:

- `Name`: Display name of the store.
- `Description`: Short description of the store.
- `Address` (for physical stores):
    - Street
    - City
    - State/Province
    - ZIP/Postal Code    
    - Country
- `Website` (for online or hybrid stores): Optional URL.
- `Aisles`: Optional ordered list of aisle names or categories, useful for physical store navigation.

### üç¨ Items

Items represent general products that can be added to shopping lists. Items include:

- `Name`: The product name (e.g., "Milk", "USB Cable").
- `Description`: Optional additional details or notes.
- `Category`: General classification (e.g., Dairy, Electronics).

### üè¢ Store Items

Store-specific representation of an item, linked to both an Item and a Store. It includes:

- `ItemId`: Reference to the shared item definition.
- `StoreId`: Reference to the store.
- `Price`: Store-specific price.
- `Aisle`: Optional location or category within the store.
- `Notes`: Optional store-specific information.

### üìÜ Shopping Lists

Users can maintain multiple shopping lists, each associated with a store. A list contains:

- `Title`: Name of the shopping list.
- `StoreId`: The store (or website) the list is for.
- `Items`: Collection of `StoreItems` linked to the list.
- `IsArchived`: Whether the list is active or archived.
- `GroupId`: (Optional) Reference to the group that owns the list.
